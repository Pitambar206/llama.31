# ðŸ“„  Document Question Answering with LangChain, FAISS, and LLaMA 3.1-8B
* This repository contains an implementation of a Document Question Answering (QA) system leveraging LangChain, FAISS vector store, and the LLaMA 3.1-8B model. The LLaMA model is optimized using 4-bit quantization (NF4) via the BitsAndBytes library to enable efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware.

### Features:
* LLaMA 3.1-8B Model: Utilizes the powerful LLaMA 3.1-8B language model for generating accurate answers based on the provided documents.
* 4-bit Quantization: Employs NF4 quantization with the BitsAndBytes library to reduce memory usage and speed up inference without significant loss of accuracy.
* FAISS Vector Store: Efficiently stores and retrieves document embeddings using the FAISS vector database, enabling fast and accurate document retrieval.
* LangChain Integration: Seamlessly integrates with LangChain to create a flexible and modular QA pipeline.

### How It Works:
* Document Ingestion: Convert documents into embeddings using the LLaMA model and store them in a FAISS vector store.
* Retrieval Chain: Set up a retrieval chain that fetches relevant documents based on a user query.
* Answer Generation: Generate a contextual and accurate answer using the LLaMA model based on the retrieved document content.

### Use Cases:
* Legal Document Review: Quickly extract answers from legal documents.
* E-learning Platforms: Enhance learning experiences with instant, contextually relevant answers.
* Enterprise Knowledge Bases: Enable fast querying of internal documents and knowledge resources.
